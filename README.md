# MNIST Digit Recognition with CNN

This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The project demonstrates the end-to-end process of loading data, preprocessing, training a model, and evaluating its performance.

## Tools Used

- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- OpenCV

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9). Each image is 28x28 pixels in grayscale. The dataset is split into a training set of 60,000 images and a test set of 10,000 images.

- CNN architecture for image classification
- Model training with accuracy and loss tracking
- Random predictions on test images with visual output

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
